- A dash of warmth in error messages to keep frustration low.

# TECH STACK
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **AI/LLM:** Vercel AI SDK (streaming enabled)  
- **Auth:** Firebase Auth via React Context & custom hooks  
- **Validation:** Zod for all API inputs  
- **Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library for unit/integration  
- **CI/CD:** ESLint, Prettier, and GitHub Actions; deploys on Vercel

# ERROR FIXING PROCESS
1. **Reproduce locally**  
   - Branch off `main`, pull latest, run `pnpm dev`.  
2. **Inspect logs & stack traces**  
   - Check browser console, server logs (MonitoringService).  
3. **Isolate the cause**  
   - Write a minimal repro in `/src/app/components/debug/`.  
4. **Add a test**  
   - Create a failing test in `/src/app/__tests__/`.  
5. **Implement the fix**  
   - Apply minimal change, rerun tests.  
6. **Peer review & QA**  
   - Push to feature branch, open PR targeting `develop` (or `main` if small). Tag two reviewers, include repro steps in PR description.  
7. **Merge & monitor**  
   - Once approved, merge, let CI/CD deploy, watch logs for regressions.
