Adhere to a modern, minimalistic design with consistent brand colors, typography, and visual hierarchy.
Maintain intuitive navigation; interactive elements must enhance, not hinder, usability.

Visually compelling content with clear communication of the agency's expertise.

Task
Using Next.js App Router, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, build a digital portfolio app (ImagiNative AI Studios App) that draws inspiration from the Gengrove Imperials UI design. Incorporate:

Minimalistic, modern layout with strong visual hierarchy.
High-impact hero sections and carefully placed stats or highlights.
Dynamic transitions and responsive design.
Clear CTAs and intuitive navigation.
Your solution should follow Next.js best practices for:

File-based routing (App Router).

Accessibility and SEO (e.g., using <Head>, meta tags, alt attributes).
Finally, ensure the app meets the creative agency portfolio requirements:

Work/Case Studies with interactive previews.
Services section detailing capabilities.
About section that highlights the team and design philosophy.
